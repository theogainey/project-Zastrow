# [How To Apply CSS Styles to HTML with Cascade and Specificity](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-apply-css-styles-to-html-with-cascade-and-specificity)

My work from the first tutorial in Philip Zastrow's [How To Style HTML with CSS tutorial series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on DigitalOcean. This tutorial gives an introduction to the different ways to add CSS styles to an HTML document. First this tutorial shows how both the `style` attribute and the `<style>` element can embed styles within an HTML document. Next this tutorial demonstrates how to link an HTML document to an external stylesheet. Finally, an introduction into how the cascade and specificity layers affect the presentation of an HTML document is given.
