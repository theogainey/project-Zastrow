# [How To Use Color Values with CSS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-color-values-with-css)

This tutorial introduces the different ways to use color in CSS. One way to use color is to use predefined colors by using color keywords.  Another way is to make use of Hexadecimal and `rgb()` values. Both of these values define color in the same way but differ in how they are written. One more way to use color is to make use of `hsl()` values. `hsl()` values define color in a way that is useful when using a color scheme consisting of complementary colors.
